## Hello there, I'm Zakariyyaa ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate at Imperial College London studying a MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I'm passionate about Robotics, Embedded System Design, Machine Learning and Edge AI.

## Projects
I've worked on a variety of projects over the years, but here's a list of the ones I enjoyed the most

### [D-PALI 3D](https://github.com/Maximilian-Adam/D-PALI)
- In this project, we were tasked with developing an existing robotic gripper ([D-PALI](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/manipulation-touch/research/d-pali/)), to extend it's workspace to 3D.
- The gripper was designed to provide affordable and reliable in hand manipulation
- A Mujcoco physiscs environment was used alongside reinforcement learning (in python) to develop policies for both position and orientation adjustment

### [Embedded Music Synthesiser](https://github.com/ogahector/synth_player)
- A music synthesiser developed to: play notes, volume and octave control, recording and playback functionality, waveform control, and the ability to seamlessly connect to other sythesisers via the CAN bus.
- Fully working DOOM-like 3D game with purpose-built game engine, obstacles, enemies, shooting functionality, and chunk-based world generation
- A graphical user interface on an LCD screen
- DMA for simplifed synchronisation 
- Multi-Threaded architecture designed to optimise CPU utilisation and time efficiency, 

### [PiTrainer - Personal Gym Coach](https://github.com/lolzio5/PiTrainer)
- An AI powered Embedded system that utilises a RaspberryPi (in python) and an app developed in React, compatible with both Andrioid and iOS.
- Utilises an accelerometer and magnetometer, and a mixture of moving average and Kalman filters, and advanced algorithms to determine rep performance analysis
- A custom trained machine learning model to enhance performance analysis

### [4DOF Robotic Manimpulation](https://github.com/ogahector/y3_robotics)
- Using Dynamixel Servos on a 4DOF robotic arm to do a variety of tasks including : pick and place, stacking cubes and rapid, precise manipulation
- Developed and run in Matlab

### [Optimised Nios II Design for Computationally Expensive Tasks](https://github.com/Zakattack1045/DSD)
- A custom digital architecture implemented on a Nios II processor on a Cyclone V FPGA
- Utilises dedicated hardware blocks, alongside custom hardware blocks, such as a CORDIC architecture, optimised to provide precise results in as few clock cycles as possible, whilst also minimising resource usgae
- The whole system is also pipelined and optimised so that the given function, calculating over 65,000 values, went from 35s to compute down to 30ms.
- Using Verilog, System Verilog and C.

### [2 Wheeled Balancing Robot](https://github.com/mxwlc/ee2project-2024-robot-power)
- A 2 wheeled robot running on an ESP32
- An IMU sensor was used as the input to a cascaded control system I designed which allowed the robot to balance, move and turn on just two wheels.
- Using nexted PID control loops, I was able to create a very robust system that was very tolerant to disturbances.
- A camera was also mounted atop the robot, and computer vision was used to give it movement instructions
- Used C++ and python

### [Mars Rover](https://github.com/Zakattack1045/Zenithar)
- Created a 'Mars' rover that was capable of using a variety of sensors to determine information emitted from 'Aliens'
- I designed a website used to remotely control the rover, via keyboard, touch or gamepad inputs
