## Hello there, I'm Zakariyyaa ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate at Imperial College London studying for an MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I'm passionate about Robotics, Embedded System Design, Machine Learning, and Edge AI.

## Projects
I've worked on a variety of projects over the years, but here's a list of the ones I enjoyed the most:

### [D-PALI 3D](https://github.com/Maximilian-Adam/D-PALI)
- In this project, we were tasked with developing an existing robotic gripper ([D-PALI](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/manipulation-touch/research/d-pali/)) to extend its workspace to 3D.
- The gripper was designed to provide affordable and reliable in-hand manipulation.
- A MuJoCo physics environment was used alongside reinforcement learning (in Python) to develop policies for both position and orientation adjustment.

### [Embedded Music Synthesiser](https://github.com/ogahector/synth_player)
- A music synthesiser developed to: play notes, control volume and octave, enable recording and playback functionality, waveform control, and the ability to seamlessly connect to other synthesisers via the CAN bus.
- Fully working DOOM-like 3D game with a purpose-built game engine, obstacles, enemies, shooting functionality, and chunk-based world generation.
- A graphical user interface on an LCD screen.
- DMA for simplified synchronisation.
- Multi-threaded architecture designed to optimise CPU utilisation and time efficiency.

### [PiTrainer - Personal Gym Coach](https://github.com/lolzio5/PiTrainer)
- An AI-powered embedded system that utilises a Raspberry Pi (in Python) and an app developed in React, compatible with both Android and iOS.
- Utilises an accelerometer and magnetometer, a combination of moving average and Kalman filters, and advanced algorithms to determine rep performance analysis.
- A custom-trained machine learning model to enhance performance analysis.

### [4DOF Robotic Manipulation](https://github.com/ogahector/y3_robotics)
- Used Dynamixel servos on a 4DOF robotic arm to perform various tasks including: pick and place, cube stacking, and rapid, precise manipulation.
- Developed and run in MATLAB.

### [Optimised Nios II Design for Computationally Expensive Tasks](https://github.com/Zakattack1045/DSD)
- A custom digital architecture implemented on a Nios II processor on a Cyclone V FPGA.
- Utilises dedicated hardware blocks alongside custom blocks, such as a CORDIC architecture, optimised to provide precise results in as few clock cycles as possible, while minimising resource usage.
- The entire system is pipelined and optimised, reducing function computation time over 65,000 values from 35s to 30ms.
- Developed using Verilog, SystemVerilog, and C.

### [2-Wheeled Balancing Robot](https://github.com/mxwlc/ee2project-2024-robot-power)
- A 2-wheeled robot running on an ESP32.
- An IMU sensor was used as input to a cascaded control system I designed, allowing the robot to balance, move, and turn on just two wheels.
- Using nested PID control loops, I created a robust system highly tolerant to disturbances.
- A camera was mounted atop the robot, and computer vision was used to give it movement instructions.
- Developed using C++ and Python.

### [Mars Rover](https://github.com/Zakattack1045/Zenithar)
- Created a 'Mars' rover capable of using various sensors to detect information emitted from 'Aliens'.
- I designed a website used to remotely control the rover via keyboard, touch, or gamepad inputs.
